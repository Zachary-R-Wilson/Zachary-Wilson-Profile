<h3>Good Night</h3>

<p>
    Come on Dad, tell me a story about when you were a kid, Mitchell said from his bed. Blake, turning around from the door, said: you have a long day tomorrow. But Dad, Michell cried, I promise I’ll sleep if you tell me one story. Okay Moose, Blake sighed, one story and then it’s bedtime. YES!!! Mitchell exclaimed. Just don’t tell your mother I let you stay up late, Blake said before starting his story.

    Back when I was a boy scout, they had special trips called high adventures. Well I happened to go on one back then. I remember sitting in the lobby and the scoutmaster walked out saying, whoever has an interest in going to Philmont come sign this sheet. I, having little idea what I was getting into, signed up for the trip of my life. This was my call to adventure.  I had heard about Philmont from my Uncle who went many years before me, and he told me about how good it was. Inspired by my Uncle’s nostalgia, I attended every meeting to make sure I was eligible to go. It turns out I had to be at least 16 before we left, and I had to be a star scout. I was turning 16 in November, so I passed there, however, I was not yet a star scout. I made sure to work towards it, and by the end of the month I was a proud star scout.

    With our group decided upon, it was very important to make sure that we were up to the challenge that awaited us. Not only did we stay after to learn more about the tasks we would need to perform on the trail, but we needed to go on hikes. These practice hikes helped us get used to moving on our legs for long periods of time, and eventually carrying weight in our bags. This was the crossing of the threshold. These practice hikes varied in difficulty, but the most memorable one I can recall was wet. Hiking through mud, we persevered. We refused to give up, even when the trail was flooded and impassable, we made our own path. We sang songs as we hiked to keep morale up. We pushed through what were the worst conditions to prepare ourselves for the mountains.
</p>
<p>
    After all our training, we headed down to Philmont, New Mexico. Upon arrival at base camp, we were greeted by our trail guide. Making sure bears wouldn’t eat us while on the trail, he looked over all our gear. Stepping off the bus, I braced myself for what was to come. For the first few days our guide showed us how to live on the trail: cooking, cleaning, entertainment, and direction. However, he departed on day three, leaving us to continue our trek alone.

    By day Five, we were pros, nothing could stop us. Or at least that’s what I thought. Day six came along, and this was the biggest challenge we had to face. It was the fabled mount Baldy. Standing at an elevation of 12,441 ft, I couldn’t help but stare up at it. Excited, we set off and aimed to get to the top. Several hours later, we took our first break. We hadn’t made it to the top yet, but it felt so close, although it still looked like a long way up. Undeterred, we continued our hike to the top. Two more hours passed before we made it to the top. Once we reached the summit, I signed the time capsule sheet. Resting on the summit, I thought to myself about how the mountain is a metaphor for life, and how life is the journey to the top. It’s not about reaching the top as fast as possible, but rather the journey to the top. All the people who help you as you climb through life, and once you reach the top you can look back on all the paths you took to reach the summit. However, you can’t stay on the summit forever, you will leave eventually. This was my ultimate boon. Turning down the mountain, we departed the summit.

    For the next three days, we made our way back to base camp. These last days were easy, all but one. My tent mate, Ian, got sick on day eight, making it more difficult on the rest of us. We all split up his gear, to help him recover, and we took more breaks than normal. By the time we made it back to base camp, Ian had recovered. The first thing we did upon arrival at base camp was shower. This was a well-deserved and much needed shower. The return of the threshold is shown here. The next day we were on our way home.

    Snoring softly, Mitchell laid there. Quietly saying goodnight, Blake left the room. Closing the door, glancing back at Mitchell, he prophesied, one day you’ll climb your own mountain, and tell your kids all about it.
